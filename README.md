# LO02_Project

Project of reproducing a card game named [Karmaka](https://www.karmaka-game.com) to learn Java and improve my understanding of OOP.  
The Menu class contains the main of the program.

## How to play

The game will inform you of what to do at each step and you only need to enter the number corresponding to the choice except on the choice of the name of the players.  
The source code is in English but the prompts and strings visible to the users are in french.

## Compilation

The game is made using JDK 17, so it should be compatible with Java 17+.
